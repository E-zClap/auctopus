"""Offline stand-in for every model role, used by the dry run and the tests (no keys, no network, no cost).

Replies are deterministic and carry exactly the machine-readable lines the prompts ask for (KEEP, SELECTION, BEST SEED,
VERDICT, FIGURE(S), FEASIBILITY, LAB-DECISION, SAFETY, RERUN-DECISION, FILE blocks), so every branch of the pipeline
can be exercised. The replies depend on the stage and the attached files, never on the prompts' wording. Scenarios:
    win-first          the first batch produces a selection
    revision-then-win  the first batch is rejected with a best seed; its revision batch wins (default)
    never-win          nothing is ever selected (the run must stop after proposals.max_batches)
    lab-redo           the PI's triage says NO-GO, the manager's design is approved, the safety agent asks for one
                       correction, and the first acquisition fails and is repeated with amendments

\title{Exact Calibration Laws for Disordered Spin Ensembles (mock)}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
A mock manuscript produced by the dry run of the pipeline.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
This file exists so that every downstream stage has a paper to work on.
\section{Theory}
Exactly $L^2+1$ calibrations determine every sequence of at most $L$ pulses.
